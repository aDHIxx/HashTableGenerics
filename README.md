# HashTable Generics Java Implementation

This repository contains a Java implementation of a generic HashTable designed to find the frequency of words in sentences and handle word removal.

## Repo Structure

The repository is organized as follows:

- `.gitignore`: Specifies intentionally untracked files to ignore.
- `src/com/bridgelabz/hashTableGenerics/MyMapNode.java`: Defines the `MyMapNode` class representing a node in the HashTable.
- `src/com/bridgelabz/hashTableGenerics/myHashTable.java`: Implements the `myHashTable` class for creating and manipulating the HashTable.
- `src/com/bridgelabz/hashTableGenerics/WordFrequencyCounter.java`: Demonstrates the ability to find the frequency of words in sentences.
- `src/com/bridgelabz/hashTableGenerics/RemoveWords.java`: Demonstrates the ability to remove specific words from a sentence.
